### Project Overview

This goal of this project is to create an intuitive and comprehensive Power BI Report for descriptive analytics in the Singapore real estate industry. The aim is to make this report user-friendly and informative while at the same time provide users with valuable insights and visualizations.

### Data Sources

HDB Resale Data: The dataset that is used to create Power BI report is "hdb_resale_flats.csv". Detail information of the data can be found in "Data_Dictionary.pdf".

### Tools

- Power BI

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In preparing the data, following tasks are performed:
1. Data loading from csv file
2. Inspecting missing or duplicate data. Performing calculation to fill in blank
3. Splitting geolocation data into dimension tables
4. Creating calendar table
5. Adding relationship between tables
6. Creating hierarchy for location and dhb types
7. Creating table for slicer visual
8. Other calculation including remaining lease year
9. Creating different measures for calculations and visualizations

### User Interaction

1. Buttons are added for information, slicer, Q&A, and drill through
2. Drill throughs are added with the flexibility of user's selection of data
3. Map is used for users who are not familiar of the locations
4. User is abe to drill up and down for visualization with hierarchy fields

### Data Analysis

Other than normal statstic values (minimum, maximum, etc.) and graphs, influencer and Q&A are added for quick analysis.

### Results/Findings

This report is useful to:
1) Resale flat buyers looking for hdb that meet their budget
2) Resale flat sellers and agents looking for acurate property valuation
3) Authorities looking for regulating real estate market by monitoring the macro and micro trends in a simple report

### Recommendations

The report can be further improved with machine learning features in Power BI.
